 My name is Vadim Bowbel and I am a 22 year old Junior Web Developer based in Berlin.
 <br />
 Since I was little my dream was always to work in the tech world. 
 I grew up with a huge passion for tech and started building my own computers with 14, trying to learn how to write scripts with python 
 and modified/ modded my favourite video games and still do to this day. 
 I wanted to try out as much professions as I could in order to explore all the chances and oppurtunities.  
 It led to a truly diverse portfolio and my work experience ranges from working in a Hotel/ Restaurant, Accountant or Sales Team Lead. 
 And in the Winter of 2021 I started to embark to my new journey as a Web Developer. 
 I am constantly working on my skills and try to improve my workflow. 
 I want to contribute something meaningful to the company that I work for and make a positive impact on my peers around me!

 I am always open and grateful for new oppurtunities and hope to talk to you soon!
